## Project Description
In Project 9, we added lighting effects to PA8. We added per-vertex lighting and per-fragment lighting, with the shaders swappable with a keystroke. The parameters of the lighting can be adjusted.

## The code for this project can be found in Courtney Palmer's GitHub repository in the PA9 folder.
