# PA2: Interaction
This program will cause a multi-colored cube to spin around its own center axis and orbit around a center point.
Keyboard and mouse interaction will cause the cube's orbit and/or spin to reverse or pause/unpause.

### Makefile Instructions 
The makefile works as expected and must be updated with new files added in.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../makefile .
make

```
The Shaders are in the Assets folder.
