## Project Description
In Project 8, we created a simple 'board' with 3 objects: a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder. The cylinder is a static object while the sphere and cube are dynamic objects. Input is provided so that the the cube can hit the ball to make it move and bounce against the walls of the board and the cylinder. 

## The code for this project can be found in Courtney Palmer's GitHub repository in the PA8 folder.
