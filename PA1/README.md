# PA1: Spinning Cube

This program will cause a multi-colored cube to spin around its own center axis and orbit around a center point.

### Makefile Instructions 
The makefile works as expected and must be updated with new files added in.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../makefile .
make
./Tutorial
```

## Instructions for graders
Use this line in the terminal to run the program:
```bash
./Tutorial shader-v.txt shader-f.txt
```
The Shaders are in the Assets folder.
