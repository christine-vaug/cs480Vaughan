## Project Description
In Project 7, we created a model solar system. The origin hosts the sun, and all nine planets orbit it and rotate at each planets' respective speeds. The planets have the appropriate number of moons, which also rotate and orbit their planets.

## The code for this project can be found in Ashanti Cudiamat's GitHub repository in the PA7 folder.
